## Introduction

We often lack the courage and ability to give and receive feedback optimally:

* when we give feedback, we observe the receiver isn't good at receiving it
* when we receive feedback, we observe the feedback provider isn't good at delivering it

## "Push" vs. "Pull"

Emphasis can be placed upon the feedback receiver to "pull" rather than focusing on the "push" from the feedback giver, since pushing harder rarely improves genuine learning.

### Creating "Pull"

Receiving feedback well is a skill which can be learned and cultivated.  A key person involved in our individual learning is ourselves (not our teachers or mentors).  Excellent teachers and mentors are rare, so the majority of our learning comes from mediocre folks; thus we have no choice other than to get good at learning from anyone.

### Learning vs. Acceptance

Feedback reception occurs at the conflicting convergence of our two needs:

1. to learn and improve
2. to be loved and accepted "as is"
