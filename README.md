## Introduction

We often lack the courage and ability to give and receive feedback optimally:

* when we give feedback, we observe the receiver isn't good at receiving it
* when we receive feedback, we observe the feedback provider isn't good at delivering it

## "Push" vs. "Pull"

Emphasis can be placed upon the feedback receiver to "pull" rather than focusing on the "push" from the feedback giver, since pushing harder rarely improves genuine learning.

### Creating "Pull"

Receiving feedback well is a skill which can be learned and cultivated.  A key person involved in our individual learning is ourselves (not our teachers or mentors).  Excellent teachers and mentors are rare, so the majority of our learning comes from mediocre folks; thus we have no choice other than to get good at learning from anyone.

### Learning vs. Acceptance

Feedback reception occurs at the conflicting convergence of our two needs:

1. to learn and improve
2. to be loved and accepted "as is"

### How to Receive Feedback Well

* active participation in the converstation
* manange emotional triggers to properly listen
* open-mind to seeing ourselves from different perspectives

### Benefits of Receiving Feedback Well

* long-term health and happiness
* rich relationships
* improve self-esteem
* difficult feedback is less threatening
* lower attrition at work
* higher job satisfaction
* higher job performance ratings
* show good examples for our children to mimic

## Three Triggers (that block feedback)

When we are emotionally comprimised, we cannot properly think or learn, thus we defend, attack, withdraw, deny, etc. which inhibits us from engaging in a skillful conversation to proplerly receive feedback.

### 1. Truth Triggers

Truth triggers occur based upon the content of the feedback.

1. **Our first task is to understand the feedback.  There's 3 types of feedback:**
   * appreciation
   * coaching
   * evaluation
2. **We have blind spots:**
   * we are blind to certain things about ourselves
   * we are blind to the fact that we are blind (double ignorance)
   * our blind spots are obvious to others

### 2. Relationship Triggers

1. **Dynamic Switchtracking**
    * changing the topic dynamically in converation
    * don't focus on more than one topic at at time
2. **Relationship System**
    * Neither participant in a relationship may see they are both caught in a negatively reinforcing loop in which each participant contributes towards the problem

### 3. Identity Triggers

1. **Wiring and Temperment**
   * Our identity is established through the story we tell ourselves about ourselves.  Understanding our individual wiring patterns and temperment allows us to more clearly see why we react in the ways we do as feedback receivers.
2. **Dismantle Distortions**
    * We often respond to our distorted perception of the feedback, not the feedback itself.
3. **Cultivate a Growth Identity**
    * Welcome input since it allows us to continually improve

## Truth Triggers (and the challenge to SEE)

‚≠ê **Question:** Why is it that often as **feedback givers**, we **feel right**; but as **feedback receivers**, we **feel wrong**?

Truth triggers are created by our intelluctual and emotional reactions to "wrong feedback."

## Truth Triggers: Separate Appreciation, Coaching, and Evaluation

### The Paradox of our Reactions

As feedback receivers, we may sometimes feel positive, energetic, and well; and other times feel negative, sapped, and unwell.  These reactions are tightly coupled to our interpretation of the feedback.

### Three Kinds of Feedback: Appreciation, Coaching, Evaluation

Each kind of feedback serves its own purpose and has unique challenges.

#### 1. Appreciation

Appreciation is motivating and energizing:

* thanks
* wow, look at you
* you've been working hard
* you matter

#### 2. Coaching

Coaching satisifies 2 needs:

1. knowledge, skillset, and capability improvement
2. problem identification in relationships
  a. created by painful emotions (hurt, fear, anxiety, anger, confusion, loneliness, etc.)
  b. something is "missing" or "wrong" in the relationship
  c. the "problem" is how the feedback giver feels (a perceived inbalance in the relationship)

#### 3. Evaluation

Evaluations are implicit and explicit comparisons against specific criteria (our colleagues' performance or company standards).

* tells you where you stand, so we can feel safe and sound
* align expectations
* clarify consequences
* informs decision making

Evaluations can contain judgements which reach beyond the original assessment, and combined with our opinion, negative judgements are a significant source of our anxiety towards receiving feedback.

## First Understand: Shift from "That's Wrong" to "Tell Me More"

We often skip truly understanding feedback and jump straight into judgements and defensive wrong spotting.  Wrong spotting is easy because there's almost always something wrong which the feedback giver is overlooking or misunderstanding; however, wrong spotting defeats learning.  There's often a disconnect between what was heard by the feedback receiver and what was ment by the feedback giver.

Feedback is initially perceived as "labels" which are generalized ideas and topics.  It is the feedback receiver's responsibility to "spot the label" and see what's underneath it.  Label spotting is easy, what's hard is remembering to do it.  Once we've identified a label, we need to fight our internal urges to fill in our own meaning about the contents of it.

Underneath feedback labels there are historical and future components:

1. Historical component: "here's what I noticed"
2. Future component: "here's what you need to do"

To clarify the feedback underneath the label, we need to be specific about where the feedback is historically coming from and where the feedback is headed towards in the future.

### Where the Feedback is Coming From

All advice is autobiographical, the feedback we give to others is based upon our own life's experiences and perceptions, ie. my feedback for you is based upon me.

Feedback givers arrive at their lables in 2 ways:

1. they observe data
2. they interpret that data to tell themselves a story about what it means

The process of moving from data to interepration of data is instantaneous and unconscious.

### Where the feedback is Going To

* Coaching feedbacks's future component is about advice
* Evaluation feedback's future component is about consequences and expectations

Given evaluation feedback, we are often *not* in a curious state of mind for learning from it.  Good questions to ask ourselves when given evaluation feedback:

* What does this mean for me?
* What will happen next, what is expected of me?
* Given where I stand, what should I do now?

Feedback givers and receives have different life data points and interpretations of those data points, so it is important to see the other's point-of-view for hollistic understanding and potential learning.  Thus difference spotting and right spotting with an open-mind is beneficial whereas wrong spotting is detrimental to understanding feedback and learning from it.

## See Your Blind Spots: Discover How You Come Across

### The Gap Map

My Thoughts & Feelings üëâ My Intentions üëâ My Behavior üëâ My Impact on Others üëâ Other's Story About Me

* There's always a gap between how we think we present ourselves and the way others see us.
* I judge myself based on my intentions, others judge me based on my impacts on them.
* My behavior in my awareness is *not* the same as my behavior in other's awareness

### Behavioral Blind Spots

#### Your Leaky Face (and tone of voice)

* Our own face is a blind spot because we are trapped inside ourselves looking outwards.
* We hear others through our superior temporal sulcus (STS), but the STS turns off when we hear ourselves speaking.
* Others perceive not just *what* we are saying, but *how* we say it
  * Facial expressions
  * Tone of voice
  * Body language

#### Blind Spot Amplifiers

1. Emotional Math
   * Our emotions are integral in how others perceive and interact with us
1. Situtation vs Character
   * We judge our behaviors based upon *situations*, others judge our behaviors based upon our *character*.
3. Intent vs Impact
   * We judge ourselves upon our internal *intentions*, others judge us based on our external *impacts*
   * Feedback given is often loaded with assumed intentions

### What Helps Us See Our Blind Spots?

We can use our reaction to feedback as a blind spot alert.  When we notice ourselves asking:

* What was their agenda?
* What's wrong with them?

Then we can ask ourselves:

* I wonder if this feedback is in my blind spot?
* What do you see me doing, or failing to do, which is getting in my own way?
  * If we respond with genuine curiosity and appreciation, feedback givers can help provide useful details to learn from as feedback receivers

#### Honest vs Supportive Mirrors

People we rely on for support are often hesitant to share critial, honest feedback with us since we aren't asking the mirror for an honest assessment; we're instead asking for reassurance and support.  When someone has been a supportive mirror, we can feel betrayed and blindsided when they suddendly become and honesty mirror.

#### Record Yourself

For many of us, watching ourselves on video or hearing ourselves on audio is unpleasant at best.  But it can be enormously illuminating, enabling us to hear our own tone and see own our behavior in ways that are normally invisible to us.

#### Focus on Change from the Inside-Out

Simply acknowledge the pattern that everyone already sees, and be clear you're trying hard to change.
